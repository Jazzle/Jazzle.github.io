Today we started to look at repl.it and python with turtle. We started to look at python last year with Codecademy(?) but the introduction of a turtle allows for more option including drawing shapes easier. We discovered that we can use functions to create a way of drawing shapes. By using two parameters, we could look at how many sides the shape had, the angle (360/n) and the side length. From this, we could figure out how to draw the shape using a loop which iterate however many sides the shape has. I enjoyed starting this new adventure and making some good progress today.
