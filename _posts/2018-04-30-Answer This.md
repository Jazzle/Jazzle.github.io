Today we started to look at how we can transform a list of questions into a fully functioning quiz on 'Repl.it.' The first thing we had to do was to figure out the layout of the quiz by using comments to set out the order of statements before copy and pasting the questions in from the google doc. We used \n to create new lines where we needed to in order to make it look better. The first problem I had to overcome was what happened if the person answering didn't give a suitable option. I solved this problem by using a while true loop that was only broken if you gave a suitable answer. In two weeks time I have to figure out how to do the scoring although I already have the variables.
