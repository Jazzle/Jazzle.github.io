This week the focus was back on to spreadsheets after last week was on blogs. It was mainly a recap lesson as we looked at what we had already achieved such as with the use of 'VLookup' (for finding the price among the list of items and 'Data Validation' (to make finding objects quicker and more reliable). This was a useful lesson to remind ourselves of key functions and the way that we did the original spreadsheet. I didn't make any major changes as the shop was doing fine in its own right.
