TODAY we expanded on our use of repl.it and python with turtle and we focused on how we can create 3d letters, more specifically the letter T. By creating a T with a larger surface area, we could then focus on putting another T behind it and joining the dots. A challenge came when I had to try and figure out the side lengths but I used trial and error to eventually figure it out.
