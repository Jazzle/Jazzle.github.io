This week we reviewed the design and usefulness of our blogs. We discussed what looked good and what really didn’t and why it is important to have a blog to review the work of the lessons and to prove we had actually understood it. I decided to restart my blog as it didn’t look particularly interesting in any way. I ran into a problem when looking for a background as I couldn’t remember the formatting in the ‘style.scss’ file. This was solved by checking on the internet and I quickly moved on. I hope you like this new look blog.
