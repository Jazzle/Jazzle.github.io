Today we looked at how we could use Pythonwithout turtle to tell whether a number is prime. First of all we created a function to tell whether a number was divisible by another by using float divisionnto find out a remainder, if it is zero then it would be divisible and thus not prime. In the end we changed it to have an input for whatever number that needed to be tested. This ran into problems when trying to print the result and therefore I decided to instead use a list of numbers and just test numbers up to around 12,500.
