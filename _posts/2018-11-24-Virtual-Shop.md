Today in IT we started to look at spreadsheets. We looked at creating a virtual shop using Google Sheets. We created columns of cells for: the item, price, discount and the new price. We used 'VLookup' to find a way to record the amount of stock being sold. Through this we were able to add up the total through adding the cells in that column up until the total cell. I learnt more about the uses of spreadsheets. I encountered some difficulties when trying to use Vlookup but that was easily solved by adding an extra brackets as it wasnâ€™t closed off.
