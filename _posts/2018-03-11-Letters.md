After learning about how to draw regular 2d shapes last week, we today moved on to trying to create certain letters by defining a function and programming the turtle to move. I started with the letter A and that was easy enough but the letter J, and its curve, proved to be more challenging. By adapting my function from last week I created a way to draw a semi-circle bu getting the turtle to draw half the lines but the same angle as a full circle.Through this I was able to greatly enhance my knowledge of how typing works and how small changes can change big things.
