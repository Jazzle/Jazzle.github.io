The aim of today's lesson was to find a way to have a sale that could be changed at one cell and have an impact on everything else. By subtracting the cell showing the sale, divided by hundred, from 1 and then multiplying it by the original cost we could easily find out the new price. I have included the spreadsheet down below, with product and overall sales.
