Today we started to look at making our own quiz. We went on Buzzfeed and looked at their quizzes for inspiration. One quiz said I should live in Chicago, IL. We then discussed how quizzes can follow different formats to get results. Some may have a key question to get results whilst others assign values to whatever option you pick. After this reeearch, we moved on to creating our own quiz questions. Whilst I had some trouble with getting a result, I believe it should work.
